## Name

This is the Module 3 Challenge Assignment for Laura Jordan

## Description

This assignment includes 2 separate exercises. 

The first exercise is PyBank. In this exercise, we analyzed financial records for a company. I created a script that looked at the total months included in the dataset, the total profit/loss for the entire period, the changes in profit/losses, average of those changes, the greatest increase in profits and the dreatest decrease in profits. 

The second exercise is PyPoll. In this exercise, we analyzed poll data in Denver. I created a script that looked at the total number of votes, the list of candidates along with the breakdown of votes per candidate, and the winner of the election. 

The scripts for both exercises also include writing the results summaries to a text file.
